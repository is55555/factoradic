# SFL Simple Factoradic Lib

For now, just a bunch of functions to deal with factoradic numbers and permutations.

Language: Python2 (tested on Python 2.7), Python3 (tested on Python 3.6)

For Python2, the future package is required (pip) - nothing else really, although I provided the exact environment used
in testing.

For Python3, there are no requirements.

I made this because I found bugs in many examples online so I just did one myself from scratch to make sure everything
 works as I intended, and to grok the algorithms.

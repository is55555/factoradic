# SFL Simple Factoradic Lib

For now, just a bunch of functions to deal with factoradic numbers and permutations.

Language: Python2 (quite trivial to make Python3 compatible and maybe I will)

I made this because I found bugs in many examples online so I just did one myself from scratch to make sure everything
 works as I intended, and to grok the algorithms.
